yield_prediction.py
====================
A transparent, formula-based yield estimate — NOT a trained ML model
(that needs 2000+ labeled farm-seasons of ground-truth harvest data,
which this app doesn't have yet).

Method
------
NDVI-proportional scaling against India's published national-average
yield per crop:

    estimated_yield = national_avg_yield × (farm_NDVI / reference_NDVI)

`reference_NDVI` is the NDVI threshold this app's own crop
recommendation engine (crop_recommendation.py) already treats as
"healthy" for that crop — so a farm scoring at that NDVI gets ~100% of
the national average yield; healthier farms score above it, stressed
farms score below it. The ratio is clipped to 0.3–1.3x to avoid wild
extrapolation from a single vegetation index.

This is a documented starting point, not a substitute for a properly
trained model — the moment you have real yield data (from field
officers, harvest records), replace this with a regression/ML model
trained on YOUR farms and compare its accuracy against this proxy's.

References (approximate, for the "reference_ndvi" and "avg_yield_kg_ha"
values below): Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (India)
published state/national average yield statistics; NDVI thresholds
match crop_recommendation.py so the two stay consistent with each
other.
