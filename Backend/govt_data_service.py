govt_data_service.py
=====================
Crop Price/MSP and District Yield Comparison — the two SatSource-sheet
items that genuinely cannot come from Earth Engine, because they are
government market/agriculture-census statistics, not satellite data.

IMPORTANT — deployment note:
This calls data.gov.in's open API (Agmarknet mandi price series +
ICRISAT/DES district-level yield data mirrors). Both need:
  1. A free API key from https://data.gov.in/ (env var DATA_GOV_IN_KEY)
  2. Outbound network access to api.data.gov.in from your server

Neither is available in this dev sandbox, so this module is written and
structured but not live-tested here — test it after deploying with a
real key. Every function fails soft (returns an "unavailable" shape
with a reason) rather than crashing /calculate if the key is missing
or the API is unreachable, so the rest of the app keeps working either
way.
